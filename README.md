## Layer.ae Introduction

Layer.ae operates as Layer Marketing Services LLC, a registered company based in Dubai (Company Registration Number 900809) that has evolved significantly since its establishment. Originally starting as a hosting provider over a decade ago, Layer underwent a strategic rebrand approximately five years ago and has since expanded into a comprehensive technology solutions company.

While Layer.ae initially built its reputation around social media management, creative content services, and digital marketing for B2B clients in Dubai, the company has maintained a strong presence in the web hosting sector. Their VPS hosting infrastructure stands out for several key reasons:

**AMD Ryzen Powerhouse**: Layer.ae exclusively uses AMD Ryzen 7950X and 9950X processors, delivering exceptional single-core and multi-core performance. These CPUs operate at impressive base frequencies (4.5 GHz+), making them ideal for demanding applications, game servers, and compute-intensive workloads.

**NVMe Storage**: All plans feature NVMe (PCIe 4.0) drives, ensuring lightning-fast read/write speeds that dramatically improve application performance and data retrieval times.

**10Gbit Network**: Every VPS comes with a 10Gbit port, providing massive bandwidth capacity for high-traffic websites, media streaming, or data transfer operations.

**Global Infrastructure**: Layer.ae operates data centers in strategic locations:
- Spokane, Washington (USA) - hosted at Tierpoint Liberty Lake
- Coventry, United Kingdom
- Singapore - hosted at Racks Central
- Eygelshoven, Netherlands (newest location)

**DDoS Protection**: All services include DDoS Watch™, a proactive monitoring system that detects and mitigates malicious traffic in real-time to keep your services online.

**VirtFusion Control Panel**: Users get access to an intuitive, modern control panel for full VPS management, including instant provisioning, custom ISO uploads, automated backups, and rDNS configuration.

The company operates with a B2B and B2C approach, serving everyone from individual developers to enterprise clients across multiple continents.
